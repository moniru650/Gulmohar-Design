          <ul>
            <li>Culinary uses: Cardamom is often used in savory dishes such as stews, curries, and rice dishes. It has a strong, smoky flavor that pairs well with rich and spicy ingredients. Black cardamom is also used in spice blends such as garam masala.</li>
            <li>Health benefits: Cardamom has been used in traditional medicine for centuries to treat a variety of ailments, including digestive issues, respiratory problems, and infections. It is rich in antioxidants and may have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Some studies have suggested that consuming black cardamom may help to improve digestion and reduce inflammation.</li>
            <li>Other uses: Cardamom is sometimes used in aromatherapy and perfumes for its smoky scent. It is also used in some natural remedies, such as essential oils and herbal supplements.</li>
            <li>Preparation: Cardamom is typically sold in whole pod form, which can be opened to reveal the small black seeds inside. The seeds and pods are often used together to flavor dishes, either whole or crushed. Black cardamom pods are tougher than green cardamom pods, so they are often added earlier in the cooking process to allow them time to soften and release their flavor.</li>
            <li>Availability: Cardamom can be harder to find than green cardamom, but it is still widely available in specialty grocery stores and online.</li>
          </ul>
